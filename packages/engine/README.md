# Engine

A custom engine to handle the logic of the ultimate tic-tac-toe game. The engine can handle adding a move to a game that is underway. It can also derive game state when given an array of moves made. Because this project utilizes a monorepo, the types and functions implemented in this package are available to both the client application as well as the server application.
